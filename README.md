# Logarithmic-Strain-Space_Fortran
Fortran code for the transformation into the logarithmic strain space

## ToDo:
* requires the eigenproblem solver by Joachim Kopp
Add a note (where to save it) and the download link
* add documentation, maybe refer to basics in deal.ii equivalent repo
* add example with all "always existing lines of code" (maybe colored blocks)
* add reference to work by BuCh
